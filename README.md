Initially published in 1922, the classic work of  "The Worm Ouroboros" 
combines mythology with epic adventure. The story is set in the 
fictional universe of Mercury, where E.R. Eddison crafts a saga 
of heroic proportions along with cosmic struggle, and themes of power, 
and ambition. 

The book follows the conflict between the lords of Demonland and Witchland, 
whose ceaseless quest of power reflects the Ouroboros or the cycle of life. 
 
Ouroboros is the ancient emblem of the serpent devouring its own tail, indicating 
constant return. Eddison's archaic language echoes the works of Homer, 
Norse mythology, and Elizabethan drama.

This revised edition of Ouroboros, is meticulously crafted to ensure 
seamless compatibility across multiple devices.  Whether you're reading 
on Kindle, e-Pub readers, or any other eBook platform, this version is 
designed for a smooth and immersive reading experience, offering optimized 
formatting for both digital and print mediums.
